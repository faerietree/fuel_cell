Electricity from Electrolysis
===

At least 2 components:
---

* A _fuel cell design_ for generating electricity.
* The _fuel_ may be
  * water, which then includes salty and frozen water.
  * microbes, e.g. dung of cattle or rotten plants, e.g. waste wood.


Combustion is different
---
Note that this does not include gathering <a href="https://github.com/faerietree/electricity_from_combustion">electricity from combustion</a> of fuel. If you like such a system, create the required modules (repositories) for electricity_from_combustion (somewhere, e.g. Github or on your own server) and develop.
It (perhaps all) may be linked as (sub)module(s) into any worldevelopment base technology repository.


Why this worlddevelopment repository?
---
The <a href="https://github.com/worlddevelopment">Worldevelopment Github</a> mainly serves as collection of collections. Any (Git or SVN, not sure if hg works too) repository can be linked in as submodule.
The goal is to finally get the open source development mess in a useful structure to guide as a reference implementation of how living standards may be raised with respect to the world's eco systems.

*Note: Building this structure is a gradual process. It may be used as reference when working as a development helper in a 'developing country'. That the repositories are published online (on Github) is to allow easier access around the world. It's also planned to bring/teach living standard raising technology directly in developing countries.*
